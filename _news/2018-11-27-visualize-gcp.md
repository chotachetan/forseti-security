Customers often struggle to create hand-wired diagrams of their cloud app’s
architecture, and keeping those diagrams up-to-date as things change over time

Inventory Scanner, some clever-but-fairly-gnarly Cloud SQL, and
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) 
collapsible trees, you can automatically generate interactive architecture
diagrams that represent your GCP environment, much like this one…

If that’s something that sounds interesting, read all about it
